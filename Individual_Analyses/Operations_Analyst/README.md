#Insight 1: Same impacting factors for different countries
While there are important differences between averages, means, and ranges of the educational achievements as measured by PISA between different countries, the factors impacting these achievements do not differ significantly. That means, having computers connected to the Internet and a school band contributes to higher outcomes in math, reading, and science across many different countries.

#Insight 2: Random Forest is a better ML technique to analyze PISA datasets
Random Forest models explain a higher percentage of the variance in the labels, in our case, math, reading, and science outcomes of PISA tests in different countries, than Linear Regression models. This might be because of Random Forest's ability to account for the interaction between variables.

#Insight 3: Tech, Student-teacher ratio, and Extracurricular activities are the main drivers of educational success
- Tech means specifically access to computers with an internet connection and data projectors
- Student-teacher ratio is very important, particularly to the success in math and science
- Extracurricular activities, specifically school band/orchestra/choir, are an important contributor to math, reading, and science success
- Truancy reduction is important as well.

#Insight 4: Focus where the impact can be the largest
- Investing in tech, teachers, and extracurricular activities will have higher ROI when focusing on poorer countries
- Collaboration with governments and educational NGOs is crucial.
